You now have a variety of configuration options before creating your project in OpenRefine. 
- Select an appropriate character encoding schema.
- Select the option to `Parse next 1 line(s) as column headers.` 
  * This option treats the first row of your file as a table header.
- Check to be sure the `Parse cell text into numbers, dates, ...` option is NOT selected. 
- In the `Project name` window, name your project. 

Click `Create Project >>` to begin to work with your data as an OpenRefine project.
