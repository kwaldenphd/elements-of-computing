# Application

Q3A: Starting with the pattern errors you identified for Q1, how would you address those issues using Excel?

Q3B: Provide an outline for your data processing workflow. A set of steps or tasks is a good place to start. You're welcome to include screenshots as that would be helpful.

Q3C: Work through cleaning the `players` and `teams` tables. Once you're done, export the `.csv` files and add them to the Google Sheets template for this chapter.

Q3D: Compare your experience working in a spreadsheet program to other experiences you have had in a text editor, spreadsheet program, or OpenRefine. In what ways do you understand, perceive, or relate to the data differently through working in a spreadsheet program? Reflect on and describe your experience cleaning this data in a spreadsheet program.
