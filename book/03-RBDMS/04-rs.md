# Relational Schema

By this point you may be wondering why our data tables have various `id` columns. The ERD we built in Q1 outlines the conceptual relationships across our data structures. To put that another way, ERDs are a conceptual model of a relational database structure.

But relationship database programs require matching data fields and unique identifiers to be able to manifest those conceptual relationships. These unique identifiers and matching fields are called `keys`.

## Keys

- "The **primary key** is defined as a column (or set of columns) where each value is unique and identifies a single row of the table." ([Primary Key-Foreign Key Relationships,](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12100_01/books/admintool/admintool_DataModeling4.html) Oracle)

- "A **foreign key** is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key columns in another table." ([Primary Key-Foreign Key Relationships,](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12100_01/books/admintool/admintool_DataModeling4.html) Oracle)

### Relational Schema

ERDs are a conceptual model of the relationships in a database. An ERD may not directly map onto the structure of tables, fields, etc. in a relational database.

But, we might also want to represent our database structure based on tables, primary keys, and foreign keys. Relational schema (RS) model the logical, machine-readable relationship across tables and fields (linked by primary/foreign keys). 

Building a RS diagram involves listing fields by table, identifying relationships across tables, and which fields are serving as primary/foreign keys.

## Application

Q2A: What fields in our tables are functioning as keys? Which ones are primary keys and which ones are foreign keys? Include some explanation of your thought process.

Q2B: Build a relational schema for a relational database that includes the `players`, `teams`, `locations,` and `transactions` tables. Include your diagram as well as an explanation of your process.
