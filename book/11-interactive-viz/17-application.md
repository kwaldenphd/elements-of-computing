## Question

**Q1A: Identify a civic dataset that you want to analyze. Answer to this question notes and briefly describes the dataset you're working with. Include a link if possible.**
- *I encourage folks to use this question to explore civic data you might use for the final project.*

**Q1B: Develop an outline for your data visualization workflow. This could be a list with bullet points, a narrative, or a visual diagram (or a combination of these elements). Answer to this question includes a desired final data structure.**
- *NOTE: No code is required as part of this answer.*

**Q1C: Develop a Python program that uses `plotly` plotting functions to generate at least three different plot types using your Q1A dataset and Q1B workflows. Answer to this question includes code + comments.**
- *I encourage folks to use this question to explore visualizations you might use for the final project.*

Each plot should include the following elements:
- Title
- Axis labels
- Legend
- Scale or tickmarks
- Hover label
- Data source
 
Plot types to choose from:
- Line plots
- Bar chart
- Grouped bar chart
- Horizontal bar chart
- Stacked bar chart
- Histogram
- Box plot
- Area plot
- Scatter plot
- Pie chart
- Donut chart
- Sunburst chart
- Table

**Q1D: Add to the code for at least one of your Q1C figures to save the figure as a static image. Answer to this question includes code + comments.**

**Q1E: Add to the code for at least one of your Q1C figures to save the figure as an `.html` file. Answer to this question includes code + comments.**

**Q1F: What challenges did you encounter? How did you approach solving them?**
