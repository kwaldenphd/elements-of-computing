[Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cOshaiEA5eHhJDOi22_x3GRHsxqC0L3_?usp=sharing) for a Jupyter Notebook template for this chapter's application problems.

Q1A: Write code that generates at least 3 of the following plot types.
- Figure with subplots
- Scatterplot
- Histogram
- Bar chart (regular, horizontal, stacked, or grouped)
- Pie chart
- Boxplot
- Table
- Other

Each of the three plots needs to include the following style elements (as appropriate).
- Title
- Axis labels
- Tick marks
- Tick labels
- Line or marker style
- Line or marker color
- Legend

Each program should include code + comments. Small data samples you create manually is fine.

Q1B: Write code that saves at least one of your Q1A plots as an image file.
