That is because Matplotlib has two interfaces.\n","- The first is an `object-oriented (OO) interface`. When working in the `OO` interface, we utilize an instance of `axes.Axes` to render visualizations on an instance of `figure.Figure`.\n","- The second is based on `MATLAB` and uses a state-based interface. This second interface is encapsulated in the `pyplot` module. `pyplot` is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like `MATLAB`.\n","\n","At first glance, `pyplot` can seem like a much easier alternative to the object-oriented interface."],"metadata":{"id":"bN8XyHmwkbQf"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wb71iVpdkWu2"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # import statement\n","plt.plot([1,2,3,4]) # create plot\n","plt.ylabel('some numbers') # add label\n","plt.show() # show output"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["No figure, no axis- what magic!
