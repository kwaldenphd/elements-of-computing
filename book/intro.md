## For Elements of Computing Students 

Prof. Walden is exploring a new way of sharing instructional materials this semester. This is a work in progress!

## For Everyone Else

This site hosts instructional materials for the University of Notre Dame's "Elements of Computing II" course, the second course in a sequence that combines hands-on introduction to the basic concepts and technologies of computing with critical discussion of the historical, social, and cultural dimensions of computing, data, and digital technology. The work of the course includes discussions of content that foregrounds the cultural, social, and historical dimensions of computing technologies along with exploration and foundational skill building with various computing tools and methods.
  * [Sample syllabus](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/curriculum/blob/main/syllabi/eoc-spring.md)

Elements II focuses on data processing workflows, including exploratory analysis & visualization. This semester's iteration of the course (and the instructional resources on this site) are geared toward civic data examples.
  * The course is part of the College of Arts and Letters [Technology & Digital Studies Programs](https://altech.nd.edu/).

Folks working in and around digital studies, digital humanities, or other kinds of data literacy spaces may find these resources helpful.
