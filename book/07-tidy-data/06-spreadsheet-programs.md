# Spreadsheet Programs

Spreadsheet software programs are another commonly-used tool for interacting with structured data. Some spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Office's Excel or Apple's Numbers are proprietary software installed on a local computer. Other proprietary spreadsheet programs like Google Sheets run online and are not installed locally. Open-source spreadsheet programs include OpenOffice's Calc and LibreOffice's Calc. 

There are two options for the next section of the chapter- working in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. You are only expected to complete one of those options. 

For either option, the workflow loads individual tables into a workbook and uses spreadsheet program tools to interact with and clean (or "tidy") the data.
