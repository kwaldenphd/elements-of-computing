The arc length of each slice (and thus its central angle and area) is proportional to the quantity it represents.\n","\n","Data visualization and information perception research suggests that, while useful in some cases, making visual comparisons within a pie chart or across pie charts is challenging. This research recommends pie charts be replaced by other types of plots (scatter plots, density plots, bar charts, box plots, etc).\n","\n","To learn more:\n","- Leland Wilkinson, [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) (Springer, 2005).
