## Submitting Additional Data Files 

- Option #1: Upload the additional files as part of the Canvas submission
  * If working in Google Docs and submitting a link, youâ€™ll need a second submission for the file.
- Option #2: Put any CSV or JSON files in Google Drive and/or import to Google Sheets, check sharing permissions, and submit the URL.
  * This may require a second Canvas submission.
- Option #3: Put materials (Google Doc, Colab link, data file) in a Google Drive folder, check sharing permissions, and submit the URL on Canvas.

## Questions 

**Q1A: Find a civic data attribute dataset that has a geospatial component. This could be involve neighborhoods, districts, zip codes, addresses, etc. Answer to this question notes the attribute dataset you're working with. Include a link if possible.**

**Q1B: Determine what type of geospatial information is contianed in your dataset (point or polygon). Note this information in your answer to this question.**

**Q1C: Identify and work on next steps for connecting your attribute data to geospatial data. This might involve geocoding address data, or locating a boundary file with polygon information. Answer to this question describes next steps, specific resources, etc. If working with a boundary file, include a source link.**

**Q1D: Work on a Python program that connects your attribute and geospatial data to create a `GeoDataFrame`.**
