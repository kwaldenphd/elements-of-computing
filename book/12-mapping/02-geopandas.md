<blockquote>"GeoPandas, as the name suggests, extends the popular data science library pandas by adding support for geospatial data." (GeoPandas, "<a href="https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction.html">Introduction to GeoPandas</a>")</blockquote>

You could spend a whole semester on `GeoPandas` and Python's geospatial data workflows. We'll cover some basic workflows and highlight additional resources if folks want to go further.
