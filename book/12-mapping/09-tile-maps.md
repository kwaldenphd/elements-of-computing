# Tile Maps

Mapbox maps are tile-based maps that are rendered using tiles that join together to form the map plot. Mapbox tile maps are layer-based, where the base map layer is defined by `layout.mapbox.style`. 

The data layer plotted on the base map is controlled by a `plotly.express` or `graph_object` function.
