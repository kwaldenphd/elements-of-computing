# Application

[Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VyH2LzZG6WFwWZD-TdCCCnPVPkowGFLT?usp=sharing) for a Jupyter Notebook template for this chapter's application problems.

## Question 1

**Q1A: Identify a civic dataset that you want to analyze. Answer to this question notes and briefly describes the dataset you're working with. Include a link if possible.**

**Q1B: Develop an outline for your data analysis workflow. This could be a list with bullet points, a narrative, or a visual diagram (or a combination of these elements). Answer to this question includes a desired final data structure.**
- *NOTE: No code is required as part of this answer.*

**Q1C: Develop a Python program that calculates at least 3 summary or descriptive statistics for your dataset. At least one of these programs should include a `.groupby()` or filtering operation. Answer to this question includes code + comments.**

**Q1D: What challenges did you encounter? How did you approach solving them?**

## Question 2

**Q2A: Using your Q1 dataset (or another civic dataset), identify one of the more advanced modeling workflows you want to explore. Answer to this question briefly describes what workflow you're wanting to explore (regression, classification, etc) and how it's a good fit for your dataset.**

**Q2B: Using the resources linked in the modeling section of this chapter as a starting point, develop an outline for this data analysis workflow. This could be a list with bullet points, a narrative, or a visual diagram (or a combination of these elements). Answer to this question includes a desired final data structure.**
- *NOTE: No code is required as part of this answer.*

**Q2C: Develop a Python program that implements your Q2B outline. Answer to this question includes code + comments.**
- *NOTE: You may not get to a full working program. That's fine! Get as far as you can. Pseudocode can be helpful.*

**Q2D: What challenges did you encounter? How did you approach solving them?**
