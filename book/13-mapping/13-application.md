## Question

**Q1A: Find a civic data attribute dataset that has a geospatial component. This could be involve neighborhoods, districts, zip codes, addresses, etc. Answer to this question notes the attribute dataset you're working with. Include a link if possible.**
- *I encourage folks to use this question to explore civic data you might use for the final project.*

**Q1B: Develop an outline for your data visualization workflow. This could be a list with bullet points, a narrative, or a visual diagram (or a combination of these elements). Answer to this question includes a desired final data structure.**
- *NOTE: No code is required as part of this answer.*

**Q1C: Develop a Python program that uses `plotly` map functions to generate at least three different maps using your Q1A dataset and Q1B workflows. Answer to this question includes code + comments.**
- *I encourage folks to use this question to explore visualizations you might use for the final project.*

Each plot should include the following elements:
- Title
- Hover labels
- Scale or legend
- Data source

Types of maps to choose from:
- Geo Maps, or Outline-Based Maps
  * Point map, `px.scatter_geo()`
  * Choropleth map `px.choropleth()`
- Mapbox or Tile-Based Maps
  * Point map, `px.scatter_mapbox()`
  * Choropleth map, `px.choropleth_mapbox()`

**Q1D: What challenges did you encounter? How did you approach solving them?**
