Each delimited file is a stream of records, which consists of fields that are ordered by column. Each record contains fields for one row. Within each row, individual fields are separated by column delimiters. All fields must be delimited character strings, non-delimited character strings, or external numeric values. Delimited character strings can contain column delimiters and can also contain character string delimiters when two successive character string delimiters are used to represent one character.\" (IBM, \"[Delimited File Format](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/11?topic=utilities-delimited-file-format)\", 5 February 2022)\n","\n","A few characteristics that distinguish `.csv` files (or other plain-text delimited data formats) from proprietary spreadsheet file types:\n","- Columns in a `.csv` file don't have a value type.

JavaScript programs use JSON data structures, but we can frequently encounter JSON data outside of a JavaScript environment.\n","\n","Websites that make machine-readable data available via an application programming interface (API- more on this soon) often provide that data in a JSON format. JSON structures can vary WIDELY depending on the specific data provider, but the easiest way to think of JSON data as a plain-text data format made up of something like key-value pairs, like we've encountered previously in working with dictionaries (as a type of associative array).\n","\n","Example JSON string: `stringOfJsonData = '{\"name\": Zophie\", \"isCat\": true, \"miceCaught\": 0, \"felineIQ\": null}'`. From looking at the example string, we can see field names or keys (`name`, `isCat`, `miceCaught`, `felineIQ`) and values for those fields.\n","\n","To use more precise terminology, JSON data has the following attributes:\n","- uses name/value pairs\n","- separates data using commas\n","- holds objects using curly braces `{}`\n","- holds arrays using square brackets `[]`\n","\n","In our example `stringOfJsonData`, we have an object contained in curly braces. An object can include multiple name/value pairs. Multiple objects together can form an array.\n","\n","How is data stored in a JSON format different than a `.csv`?\n","- A `.csv` file uses characters as delimiters and has more of a tabular (table-like) structure.\n","- `.json` data uses characters as part of the syntax, but not in the same way as delimited data files.\n","- The data stored in a JSON format has values that are attached to names (or keys).\n","  * NOTE: We can mimic this structure somewhat by loading a `.csv` as a dictionary data structure\n","- JSON can also have a hierarchical or nested structure, in that objects can be stored or nested inside other objects as part of the same array.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-g5ofDSVV_U4"}}]}
