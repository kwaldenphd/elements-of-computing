# Interactive Visualization in Python

Up to this point, we have been generic static image plots in Python using a combination of `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. But in many cases we may want to generate interactive plots that can exist on the web.

This chapter provides an introduction to interactive visualization in Python, focusing on `plotly` workflows.
