# Saving & Exporting

Google Sheets projects are cloud-based, which means they are stored online (in the cloud).

Click on the `File` - `Download` menu to show export options.

Under `Download` you can see some of the other options for exporting the data.
- An Excel workbook (`.xlsx`) supports multiple tables or sheets in a single workbook file.
- Plain-text formats (tab separated values, `tsv`; comma separated values, `csv`, etc) are best for digital preservation and interoperability, but they only accept a single table.
