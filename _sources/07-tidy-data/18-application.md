# Application

Q5A: Thinking about some of the pattern errors you identified for Q1, how would you address those issues using data validation in a spreadsheet program?

Q4B: Provide an outline or framework for a data validation template for the `players` table. 
- You DO NOT need to actually create or submit a template.
- Describe what data validation options and pre-defined field options could you use. 
- You're welcome to include screenshots or sketches/diagrams if that would be helpful.
