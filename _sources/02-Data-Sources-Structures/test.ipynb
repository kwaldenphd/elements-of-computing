    "\n",
    "In this lab, we're thinking about how Python's built-in data structures (along with `Pandas` workflows) connect to how data is often structured in files or made available on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also be covering how to access data via web APIs, and preliminary workflows for text mining & documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're thinking about a couple key data structures:\n",
    "- Tabular data, or data stored as a table consisting of rows and columns\n",
    "- Data stored as name-value pairs, specifically in the JavaScript Object Notation (`.json`) format\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<tr><td><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-structured-data/blob/main/images/One_Dimensional_Array.jpg?raw=true\" width=\"500\"></p></td><td><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-structured-data/blob/main/images/Associative_Arrays.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\"></p></td></tr>\n",
    "\t<tr><td align=\"center\">Linear Array</td><td align=\"center\">Associative Array</td></tr></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can connect these two types of data structures back to the concepts of linear and associative arrays covered previously in the course. A quick refresher:\n",
    "- \"In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key...The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array\" ([Wikipedia, \"Array (data structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure))\")\n",
    "- Associative arrays are \"an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection\" ([Wikpedia, Associative Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tabular (or Delimited) Data\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-structured-data/blob/main/images/table_diagram.png?raw=true\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A delimited file is a sequential file with column delimiters. Each delimited file is a stream of records, which consists of fields that are ordered by column. Each record contains fields for one row. Within each row, individual fields are separated by column delimiters. All fields must be delimited character strings, non-delimited character strings, or external numeric values. Delimited character strings can contain column delimiters and can also contain character string delimiters when two successive character string delimiters are used to represent one character.\" (IBM, \"[Delimited File Format](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/11?topic=utilities-delimited-file-format)\", 5 February 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few characteristics that distinguish `.csv` files (or other plain-text delimited data formats) from proprietary spreadsheet file types:\n",
    "- Columns in a `.csv` file don't have a value type. Everything is a string.\n",
    "- Values in a `.csv` file don't have font or color formatting\n",
    "- `.csv` files only contain single worksheets\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't store formatting information like cell width/height\n",
    "- `.csv` files don't recognize merged cells or other kinds of special formatting (frozen or hidden rows/columns, embedded images, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Object Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "START HERE: https://youtu.be/B8AvytgCBdE?si=SIkXF1u7xFOznfv0\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-structured-data/blob/main/images/JSONSample.jpg?raw=true\" width=\"500\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is as popular way to format data as a single (purportedly human-readable) string. JavaScript programs use JSON data structures, but we can frequently encounter JSON data outside of a JavaScript environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites that make machine-readable data available via an application programming interface (API- more on this soon) often provide that data in a JSON format. JSON structures can vary WIDELY depending on the specific data provider, but the easiest way to think of JSON data as a plain-text data format made up of something like key-value pairs, like we've encountered previously in working with dictionaries (as a type of associative array).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example JSON string: `stringOfJsonData = '{\"name\": Zophie\", \"isCat\": true, \"miceCaught\": 0, \"felineIQ\": null}'`. From looking at the example string, we can see field names or keys (`name`, `isCat`, `miceCaught`, `felineIQ`) and values for those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use more precise terminology, JSON data has the following attributes:\n",
    "- uses name/value pairs\n",
    "- separates data using commas\n",
    "- holds objects using curly braces `{}`\n",
    "- holds arrays using square brackets `[]`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example `stringOfJsonData`, we have an object contained in curly braces. An object can include multiple name/value pairs. Multiple objects together can form an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is data stored in a JSON format different than a `.csv`?\n",
    "- A `.csv` file uses characters as delimiters and has more of a tabular (table-like) structure.\n",
    "- `.json` data uses characters as part of the syntax, but not in the same way as delimited data files.\n",
    "- The data stored in a JSON format has values that are attached to names (or keys).\n",
    "  * NOTE: We can mimic this structure somewhat by loading a `.csv` as a dictionary data structure\n",
    "- JSON can also have a hierarchical or nested structure, in that objects can be stored or nested inside other objects as part of the same array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading Structured Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of our work this semester will utilize `Pandas`, a powerful Python library for working with structured data. But we can also work with structured data using Python's built-in secondary data structures and the `csv` and `json` modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv` module allows us to create a `reader` object that iterates over lines in a `.csv` file. We can use it to read or load an existing `.csv` file into Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# loading delimited data as list of lists\n",
    "import csv # import statement\n",
    "file = open('example.csv') # open file\n",
    "reader = csv.reader(file) # create reader object\n",

    "##### `json`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can read JSON into Python using the `json` module, which includes a few key functions for loading JSON data into Python:\n",
    "- `json.loads()` takes a single string of JSON and loads it as a Python value\n",
    "- `json.load()` takes a JSON file (or file-like object) and loads it as a Python value\n",
    "- `json.dumps()` takes a Python value and transforms it to a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",

    "true | True\n",
    "false | False\n",
    "null | None\n",
    "\n",
    "To translate a string of JSON data into a Python value, we pass it to the `loads()` function contained in the `json` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import json # import statement\n",
    "jString = '{\"name\": \"Zophie\", \"isCat\": true, \"miceCaught\": 0, \"felineIQ\": null}' # string of JSON data\n",

    "As we've seen previously, the U.S. Census Bureau collects a wealth of information about people, households, communities, etc. They also have a [number of APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) and a [robust user community](https://www.census.gov/data/what-is-data-census-gov/guidance-for-data-users/how-to-materials-for-using-the-census-api.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike the APIs we encountered in the previous section of the lab, the Census Bureau's API requires a key. Head to the Census Bureau's [\"About\"](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html) page for developers and click the \"Request a Key\" icon. Once you've completed the \"Request a Key\" form, you should receive an API key via email. This will look like a long string of letters and numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is figuring out what Census Bureau dataset and API you want to work with. One option is to use [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/)'s data explorer interface. Keyword search results can point you to datasets of interest (which you would then have to track down in the API documentation).\n",

    "#### Constructing Your Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you jump into writing the API call in Python, use the available documentation to make sense of how the URL is structured, what variables are included in the dataset, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the Census Bureau API, your key is part of the URL. Concatenation and a string variable can be helpful here.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&SCHL=24&key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE\n",
    "```\n",

    "  * NOTE: In this example, the URL is structured to select all values for the `SEX`, `PWGTP`, `MAR` variables. This query will only return records where the `SCHL` variable value is `24`.\n",
    "  * In a scenario where we are not filtering for specific variable values, we could just include variable names separated by commas (i.e. `SEX, PWGTP, MAR, SCHL`)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Writing the API Call\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our general API workflow:\n",
    "- Customize query URL\n",
    "- Load response in Python\n",
    "- Parse the data structure to isolate the data we want\n",
    "- Store that data as a Pandas `DataFrame`\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "import requests, pandas as pd # import statements\n",
    "key = \"\" # add your key to make this a string variable\n",
    "url = f\"https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&SCHL=24&key={key}\" # use f strings and concatenation to construct the query\n",
    "r = requests.get(url) # requests data\n",
    "data = r.json() # store response\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data[1:], columns=data[0]) # create the dataframe, making the first sublist the column headers, and starting with the first row of data to avoid duplicating headers)\n",
