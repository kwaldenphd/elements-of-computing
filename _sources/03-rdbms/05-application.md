[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MKZm6q_taSeLN1Rz4R_B6y4aQ9fSVnERBKdy3J01Rw/copy) for a Google Doc template for this chapter's application problems.

## Question #1

Q1A: What entities are in the `players`, `teams`, `locations` and `transactions` tables? List the entitites by table and include some explanation of your thought process. If you're getting stuck, try describing the data included in each table using a sentence. Where are the nouns in each sentence?

Q1B: What attributes are in the `players`, `teams`, `locations` and `transactions` tables? What entities do these attributes describe? List the attributes by entity and table and include some explanation of your thought process. If you're getting stuck, go back to your list of entities from Q1A. What non-entity information in each table might describe an entity?

Q1C: What relationships do you see within and across entities in the `players`, `teams`, `locations` and `transactions` tables? What entities do these relationships connect? Include some explanation of your thought process. If you're getting stuck, go back to your list of entities from Q1B. How do these entities connect?

Q1D: Include the cardinality for the relationships you identified in Q1C. Include some explanation of your thought process.

Q1E: Build an ERD for the `players`, `teams`, `locations` and `transactions` tables. Include your diagram as well as an explanation of your process.

You can draw these by hand or use a drawing tool.
