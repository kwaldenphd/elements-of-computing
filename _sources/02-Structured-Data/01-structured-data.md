# Structured Data

Specifically, we're thinking about a couple key data structures:
- Tabular data, or data stored as a table consisting of rows and columns
- Data stored as name-value pairs, specifically in the JavaScript Object Notation (`.json`) format

<table>
<tr><td><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-structured-data/blob/main/images/One_Dimensional_Array.jpg?raw=true" width="500"></p></td><td><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-structured-data/blob/main/images/Associative_Arrays.png?raw=true" width="500"></p></td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center">Linear Array</td><td align="center">Associative Array</td></tr></table>

We can connect these two types of data structures back to the concepts of linear and associative arrays covered previously in the course. A quick refresher:
- "In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key...The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array" ([Wikipedia, "Array (data structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure))")
- Associative arrays are "an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection" ([Wikpedia, Associative Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array))
