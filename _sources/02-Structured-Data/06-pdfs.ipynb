But what about text information contained in documents?\n","\n","Enter Optical Character Recognition, or OCR.\n","\n","\"Optical character recognition (OCR) is sometimes referred to as text recognition. An OCR program extracts and repurposes data from scanned documents, camera images and image-only pdfs. OCR software singles out letters on the image, puts them into words and then puts the words into sentences, thus enabling access to and editing of the original content...OCR systems use a combination of hardware and software to convert physical, printed documents into machine-readable text\" (IBM Cloud Education, \"[What is Optical Character Recognition?](https://www.ibm.com/blog/optical-character-recognition/)\", 5 January 2022)\n","\n","OCR is an example of computer vision in action.
