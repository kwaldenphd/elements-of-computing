# Data Wrangling in Pandas

This chapter provides an introduction to reshaping and processing data in Python using Pandas. It reviews foundational syntax for interacting with a `DataFrame` and introduces time series data along with data aggregation and calculation workflows. 

It then moves to data reshaping in Pandas, including operations like `.groupby`, `.pivot`, `.melt`, `.pivot_table`, `.explode`, and `.transpose`. It introduces merging and joining operations in Pandas and includes some discussion of multi-level indexing and regular expressions.
