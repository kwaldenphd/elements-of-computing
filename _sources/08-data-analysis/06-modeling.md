A deep dive into statistical analysis and modeling techniques is outside the scope of this course. But if folks have encountered those methods in other classes, some Python resources to get started.

## `geopandas`

We've encountered `geopandas` previously, which includes robust support for analyzing geospatial data.
- [Geopandas documentation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/geometric_manipulations.html)

`geopandas` incorporates `shapely` geometry operation workflows.
- [shapely documentation](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html's)

## `spaCy` and `nltk`

We've already seen some of the building blocks for computational text analysis and natural language processing. There is a whole field of statistical analysis that focuses on working with text data.

Documentation resources:
- [spaCy 101](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101)
- [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)

Tutorials that can get folks started:
- [NLP with Python textbook](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
- [Large language models for humanists project](http://www.aiforhumanists.com/tutorials/)

## `statsmodels`

- `statsmodels` is a Python module that supports a variety of regression and linear models, time series analysis, survival and duration analysis, and multivariate statistics.
  * [Statsmodels documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/user-guide.html)
  
## `scikit-learn`

- `scikit-learn` is a machine learning Python library that supports a variety of classification algorithms (nearest neighbors, random forest, etc), regression models (nearest neighbors, random forest, etc), and clustering algorithms (k-Means, spectral, mean-shift, etc). `scikit-learn` incorporates/is built on `matplotlib` and has robust support for plotting and visualization.
