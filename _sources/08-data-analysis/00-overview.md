# Introduction to Data Analysis in Python

A deep dive into statistical methods and data modeling is outside the scope of this course. But this chapter provides an introduction to how we can start to think about types of data and operations we can perform on structured data.

It covers summary and descriptive statistics, focusing on Pandas workflows in Python. It also provides a brief introduction to the Python resources that can be used to implement more complex analysis workflows like natural language processing, regression and linear models, survival and duration analysis, multivariate statistics, and clustering and classification algorithms.
